Code smells 

"Data clumps"

Design smells 

Weak encapsulation 
	
Architecture smell 
	Procedural design 
	"Mixed components" -> SRP at component level 

	Infra classes and domain classes 

	Domain classes
		CitywiseRepor
		Pollutantwise Report
		Location 
		PollutantReading 
		AirQualityREport 
		...

Big Bang Refactoring 
	-> Strict No No
	-> Alternative -> Small one step at a time 
	

Safe vs. unsafe refactoring 
	-> When done automatically* 
	-> Small, localised changes are typically very safe (e.g., indexed for loop to foreach)

Design & Arch Analysis tools 
	-> Quantify tech debt 
	-> Design & Code metrics 
	-> Visualize structure 
 
	-> CQL -> Code Query Language 
	Large methods 
	Select * from Methods where Methods.Length > 30

Virtual refactoring 
	Doing refactoring without changing the code!! 
	
	Tangles and Fat
	
Tangles 
	-> Cyclic dependencies 
	
Fat
	-> Complexity at different levels
